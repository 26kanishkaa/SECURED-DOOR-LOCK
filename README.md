# SECURED-DOOR-LOCK
Secured Door Lock System
This project is a smart electronic security system designed to control and restrict access to doors using digital authentication methods such as password, RFID card, or biometric fingerprint. The system uses a microcontroller to verify user credentials and operates a solenoid or motor-based lock mechanism to ensure high security.
